libsha1_hmac_marshal \- Marshal an HMAC-SHA 1/0 hashing state
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <libsha1.h>

size_t libsha1_hmac_marshal(const struct libsha1_hmac_state *restrict \fIstate\fP, void *restrict \fIbuf\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR libsha1_marshal ()
function marshal
.I state
into the buffer
.IR buf .
If the function is called with
.I NULL
as
.IR buf ,
the required size for
.I buf
is returned.
.PP
A version number is marshalled into
.IR buf ,
this allows new versions of the library to
unmarshal states marshalled by older versions.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR libsha1_hmac_marshal ()
function returns the number of marshalled
bytes (or if
.I buf
is
.IR NULL ,
the number of bytes that would have been marshalled).
.SH ERRORS
None.
